Purpose:

This python function counts the number of dead ants mentioned in a line of text. The code analyzes the text for ocurrences of the word "ant" and potential "ant bodies" to estimate the number of dead ants.


HOW TO USE:

- Import the function: If the function is in a separate file, import it into your python script, using the following statement:

from my_file import count_dead_ants
# replace "my_file" with the actual file name



- Call the function: To use the function, simply call it without any arguments:

dead_ants_count = count_dead_ants()



- Access the result: The function will ask you to enter a line of text to analyze. Type the text and press Enter. The function will then return the calculated number of dead ants, which you can store in a variable:

print(f"Number of dead ants: {dead_ants_count}")
