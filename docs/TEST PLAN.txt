*TEST PLAN*

Test plan for the count_dead_ants() function

Objectives:
- Ensure the function accurately counts dead ants in varios text scenarios
- Verify its handling of edge cases and potential erros.



TEST SCENARIOS

POSITIVE

- Basic Counting of a single ocurrence of "ant"
- Counting of multiple ocurrences of "ant"
- Manages overlapping ants like "antant"
- Manages bodies with extra letters like "aant"
- Manages mixed cases with uppercase and lowercase letters like "Ant"


NEGATIVE

- Manages empty input, text with no ants
- Manages input with no text, for example, numbers
- Manages unexpected characters.




PROCEDURES

- For each scenario, call the function with the appropiate input.
- Compare the returned value of the count of dead ants.
- Record any unexpected behavior or erros for fixing.




EXPECTED RESULTS

- The function should accurately count dead ants in all positive scenarios.
- It should handle negative scenarios gracefully



ADDITIONAL CONSIDERATIONS

- Explore potential performance implications for long text inputs.
